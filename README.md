# My Personal Project

## Ski Resort Booking System

Proposal:

- **What will the application do?**  
  The application will be a system for employees of a ski resort. The application itself will allow employees to book
  and cancel ski days for guests, turn on and off lifts, provide lift status updates for guests.  As I’m designing this
  application, I want to keep the option open to expand its capabilities by adding features such as giving workers the
  ability to purchase ski tickets/passes, offering ski equipment rentals, booking lunch reservations on the mountain or
  providing notification reminders to guests about their reservations.


- **Who will use it?**  
  Employees of the ski resort will be using it as a system to manage the ski resort and provide customer service to the
  mountains guests.


- **Why is this project of interest to you?**  
  My inspiration for this project is the less than great experience I've had this year trying to use Whistler Mountains
  online booking system during Covid times. While I can only hope to build something better than what currently have in
  place, it’s something I'm familiar with and would be really happy to create some improvements.  I think this project
  is also something that could be replicated and tweaked for other business models not just specifically for a ski
  resort.
