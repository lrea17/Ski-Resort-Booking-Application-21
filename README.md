# My Personal Project

## Ski Resort Booking System

Proposal:

- **What will the application do?**  
  The application will be a platform for guests planning their trip to a ski resort.  The application itself will allow
  guests to book their preferred ski days, check the weather, get rental equipment, book a lunch location, and notify
  them when a day they would like to ski comes available (a day that previously) wasn't available. 
  

- **Who will use it?**  
  Guests who would like to visit the mountain and plan their trip to ski.  
  

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**  
  My inspiration for this project is the less than great experience I've had this year trying to use Whistler Mountains
  online booking system during Covid times. While I can only hope to build something better than the platform they
  currently have in place, its something I'm familiar with and would be really happy to create some improvements, even
  if they're only in the form of this project.  This being able to notify guests when the day they would like to ski
  become available is something that Whistler does not do now,but I think it would be super valuable. I think this
  project is also something that could be replicated and tweaked for other business models not just specifically for a
  ski resort.
